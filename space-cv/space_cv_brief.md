# Interactive Space CV - Comprehensive Development Brief

## Project Overview

This is an interactive 3D space-themed CV/portfolio for a UX/UI designer. The experience positions users as space explorers navigating through different Planets, each representing a section of the CV. The project must demonstrate exceptional UX/UI design principles while being both innovative and functional for potential employers.

## Core Concept & User Journey

### Initial Experience
- User lands on a 3D space environment with a starfield background
- A simple, cartoonish spaceship is visible in 3rd person perspective
- 5 distinct Planets are visible at different distances, each with unique colors and animations
- Free-floating camera navigation allows users to explore the space

### Planet Navigation
- Users can click on Planets to travel to them
- Travel animation: camera zooms into spaceship cockpit, stars streak past during transition
- Voice-over narration plays during travel (professional but personal tone)
- Upon arrival, camera zooms into the Planet for an immersive view
- Content displays as 2D overlay with Planet animation continuing in background

### Content Structure
**5 Main Planets:**
1. **Introduction Planet** - Blue/white (Andromeda-style) - Personal intro, summary
2. **Work Experience Planet** - Orange/red (Eagle Nebula-style) - Career history, roles
3. **Education World** - Purple/pink (Whirlpool-style) - Academic background, certifications
4. **Accolades Planet** - Golden/yellow tones - Awards, recognition, achievements
5. **Community Career Planet** - Multi-colored (NGC collage-style) - Volunteer work, community involvement

- Mobile audio controls
- Sync audio with travel animations

## Visual Design Specifications

### Planet Visual References
Based on provided NASA imagery:

1. **Introduction Planet** (Image 3 - Andromeda)
   - Blue-white spiral structure
   - Clean, professional appearance
   - Gentle rotation and particle movement

2. **Work Experience Planet** (Image 1 - Eagle Nebula)
   - Brilliant blues with orange/yellow accents
   - Dynamic, energetic particle effects
   - Complex nebula-like formations

3. **Education World** (Image 4 - Whirlpool)
   - Deep purples and pinks
   - Structured spiral pattern
   - Thoughtful, methodical animations

4. **Accolades Planet** (Image 5 - Centaurus)
   - Golden/yellow dominant colors
   - Bright, celebratory effects
   - Radiating particle patterns

5. **Community Career Planet** (Image 2 - Multiple Planets)
   - Multi-colored, diverse appearance
   - Collaborative, interconnected visual elements
   - Varied animation patterns

### Animation Requirements
- **Planet Animations**: Continuous rotation, particle movement, pulsing effects
- **Hover Effects**: Brightening dust particles around Planets when mouse hovers
- **Transition Effects**: Smooth camera movements, star-streak effects during travel
- **Particle Systems**: Beautiful, optimized particle effects for each Planet

### Spaceship Design
